## Defining the data directory

Open a connection to the lab web browser. 

We will first define the URL from which the data can be downloaded, by concatenating the URL fo the course with the path to our dataset.

To concatenate paths, it is *recommended* to use the **R** command `file.path()`.

<small>
```{r}
url.course <- "http://jvanheld.github.io/EBA15_stats_RStudio/"
url.data <- file.path(url.course, 'practicals', '02_peak-calling','data')

```
</small>


## Loading a data table

**R** enables to download data directly from the Web.
